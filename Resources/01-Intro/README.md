## Notes
### Week 1
- Created a Github repository, and committing files using Github Desktop
- Used Terminal for Git commands, and for creation of directories for HTML and CSS files
- Created a static page for practicing HTML tags and CSS rules

### Exercise  
Inside the exercise folder are two folder, Start and End. Work with the Start folder and recreate the mockup below: 
![Exercise Mockup](/exercise/screnshot.png?raw=true "Exercise Mockup")

The End folder contains my solution, but attempt it first and try not to cheat! I have added comments into the End folder for you to figure out how the CSS works.

### Questions  
*Q: Can I create a nested ordered list which maintains its numbering?*
```
├── 1
│   ├── 1.1
│   │   ├── 1.1.1
│   │   ├── 1.1.2
│   │   ├── 1.1.3
│   ├── 1.2
│   │   ├── 1.2.1
│   │   ├── 1.2.2
```
A: Yes, you can with [CSS Counters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Lists_and_Counters/Using_CSS_counters).

*Q: How do you know which CSS rules will overwrite others?*  

A: It depends on which CSS selector rule trumps the other. For more information refer to the following:
