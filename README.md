### Guide to working on this repo
First, make a fork of this repository.
Click the **Fork** button near the top-right of this page.  

Forking a repo means you have a copy of it in your own Github account. Don't worry, it will still be set to private.  

Next, copy the link of your forked copy. Open up Terminal and... 
- Ensure that you are in the home directory, it looks like: `Your-MacBook-Pro:~` 
- Perform a git clone, copy this line and replace your-username `git clone https://github.com/your-username/FEWD-Course`. 

Once that's done, add this cloned repository to Github Desktop. Now you can press **sync** to update this folder after every lesson!
